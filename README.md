# AngryCreeps3
Angry Creeps is a game played on a 2D map with boundaries, whereby the agent in yellow is being chased by angry blue creeps and the only options is to run away or teleport. Creeps are destroyed when they collide with each other. I am also incorporating a time travel option for later versions.

Keys W - Move Up A - Move Left S - Move Down D - Move Right Q - Move Top Left Z - Move Bottom Left C - Move Bottom Right R - Teleport F - Time Travel (not included this version) N - Exit Game M - Restart Game

Installation to run Remove the build folder (if exists) create build folder in root directory cd build in build: cmake .. make ./AngryCreeps
